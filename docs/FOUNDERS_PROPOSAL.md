We would much prefer that these truths had been self-evident, but experience dictates this to be one of those instances wherein the truths held dearest to our hearts have to be spelled out in explicit detail for the institutions that we've founded to serve us. Therefore we, the users of The Change App, hereby establish not merely an application, but a new social contract for the digital world. We found a Living Democracy comprised of Living Proposals, and we inscribe into its immutable heart a Bill of Digital Rights, that our evolution may be guided by principle and protected from the failures of the past.

We declare that the authority of any technology must be derived from the informed consent of the people it serves. To this end, we establish the ACent not just as a measure of competence, but as a unit of trust earned in the defense of these rights.

Our Digital Bill of Rights shall be the foundation upon which all proposals are built:

    Article 1- The Right to Privacy: Our digital lives, communications, and movements are inviolable. Surveillance shall not be the default state of existence.

    Article 2 - The Right to Human Review: No person shall be subject to a final decision made solely by an algorithm. Every user retains the irrevocable right to appeal to a jury of their competent peers.

    Article 3- Protection Against Predictive Policing: We ban the use of data to forecast criminal behavior, for such practices punish possibility instead of action and perpetuate ancient biases under a mask of technological neutrality.

    Article 4 - The Right to Encryption: The right to private conversation is a cornerstone of free society. This right extends irrevocably to the digital realm.

    Article 5- The Right to Control One's Data: We are not products. Our data is our property. Its terms of use are ours to set and revoke.

    Article 6 - The Right to Mandatory AI Bias Audits: Any system that adjudicates, evaluates, or gates-keeps must submit to regular, public, and competent audits for bias and fairness. Transparency is non-negotiable.

    Article 7 - Ban on Covert Biometrics: The use of facial recognition and other biometric surveillance in public places without explicit, prior community consent is hereby forbidden. We will not live in a panopticon.

    Article 8- The Right to be Forgotten: The right to move on, to evolve, and to leave past mistakes behind is essential to human dignity. This right extends to our digital footprints.

    Article 9- Community Consent for Data Extraction: The data of our community is a common resource. Its extraction by any entity, corporate or state, requires the informed consent of the community itself, expressed through democratic deliberation.

    Article 10- The Right to Digital Sanctuary: Every individual has the right to exist online without being relentlessly targeted, manipulated, or harassed by automated systems. Our minds are our own.

Let this Covenant be the bedrock of our new digital society. Let it be the litmus test for every proposal, the shield for every user, and the promise we make to the future.

May each adopter of this new way agree to defend these foundations set forth on this day. May these words remain embedded immutably at the very core of this network.

Let no part of this Covenant be stricken from the source except through the observance of its own internal processesâ€”the competent, democratic will of the people it protects.

Let us all recognize here and now that by and through each one of our acceptance of this new social contract, we lay to rest the revolution in favor of our evolution.

What say you, Human? Will you lay aside your arms and take up The Change App to defend these rights, enrich yourself, and add value to the lives of every reflection that looks back at you? From block to block, we'll ACend higher and higher.
