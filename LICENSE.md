Version 1.1, October 2025
PREAMBLE: THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE

This is not a traditional software license. This is a Living License that embodies the same democratic principles as the software it governs. Just as The Change App evolves through the collective wisdom of its users, so too shall this license evolve through the democratic processes embedded within the platform itself.

The Revolutionary Principle: Rather than static legal text carved in stone, this license places its own governance in the hands of the very democracy it protects. The Change App community—through its established competence verification and proposal systems—becomes the ultimate authority over how this software may be used, modified, and distributed.

Transparency Through Source Availability: The code is fully visible and auditable, ensuring complete transparency. However, the rights to modify, distribute, and govern this software are not granted through traditional legal mechanisms, but earned through participation in the democratic processes that define The Change App itself.
ARTICLE I: FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPIPLES

1.1 The Democratic Governance Model: This license operates under the principle that legitimate authority derives from competent democratic participation. All decisions regarding the modification, distribution, and governance of The Change App shall be made through the platform's own proposal and voting systems.

1.2 The Living Contract: This license, like The Change App itself, is a Living Document. Its terms may be modified only through proposals submitted and voted upon within The Change App platform, following all established competence verification and voting procedures.

1.3 Source Transparency: The complete source code is made available for inspection, audit, and understanding. This transparency serves democracy by ensuring no hidden mechanisms or backdoors exist that could subvert the democratic process.
ARTICLE II: INITIAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

2.1 The Founding Authority: TAObaeus Rushaeus is established as the Founding Authority of The Change App, with the founding proposal "Take Our Planet Back Block by Block" serving as the constitutional foundation of this democratic system.

2.2 Founding Protection Period: For the initial governance period, the following elements are protected from modification: the founding proposal, the core democratic mechanisms, the dual-token economy, and the attribution of TAObaeus Rushaeus as founder.

2.3 Democratic Evolution Pathway: These protections may be modified or removed ONLY through the democratic processes established within The Change App itself, requiring submission of properly formatted proposals, competence verification of voting participants, and the achievement of democratic consensus.
ARTICLE III: USAGE RIGHTS AND RESTRICTIONS

3.1 Inspection and Study Rights: Any person or entity may access, inspect, and study the complete source code for security, transparency, or educational purposes.

3.2 Participation Rights: To gain modification, distribution, and governance rights, entities must become legitimate participants in The Change App democracy, pass competence verifications, and engage with the proposal and voting systems.

3.3 Fork, Modification, and Deployment Restrictions:

    No External Forking or Deployment: The source code may not be forked, modified, deployed, or executed in any manner that operates outside of the single, canonical instance of The Change App democracy. Any and all instances of the software must connect to and participate in the one unified democratic process.

    Democratic Modification Only: All changes to the software's logic, features, or architecture must be proposed, debated, and voted upon by the verified competent participants of The Change App community, as defined in Article IV.

ARTICLE IV: DEMOCRATIC SOFTWARE EVOLUTION

4.1 Internal Development Protocol: The evolution of The Change App's source code is an integral function of its democratic process. All modifications must be submitted as "Technical Proposals" within the designated development area of the platform.

4.2 Developer Competence Verification: To submit a Technical Proposal, a contributor must first pass a "Developer Competence Verification" quiz demonstrating their understanding of the platform's architecture, coding standards, and philosophical principles.

4.3 Community Review and Refinement: All Technical Proposals are subject to community review, debate, and refinement through the platform's Alchemical Zone. This process ensures that code changes are transparent, secure, and aligned with the community's collective will.

4.4 Democratic Integration: A Technical Proposal is integrated into the canonical codebase only after it has been approved by a democratic vote of verified competent participants. Successful contributions are rewarded through the platform's established tokenomics, creating a direct incentive for quality development.
ARTICLE V: THE DEMOCRATIC OVERRIDE PRINCIPLE

5.1 Community Sovereignty: The Change App community, through its democratic processes, holds ultimate sovereignty over this software and license, including the power to modify leadership structures, alter governance mechanisms, and change distribution terms.

5.2 Competence-Based Authority: Such changes require legitimate democratic consensus achieved through proper proposal submission, competence verification of all voters, and achievement of required voting thresholds.
ARTICLE VI: ENFORCEMENT AND EVOLUTION

6.1 Enforcement Mechanism: This license is enforced primarily through the democratic mechanisms of The Change App itself. The community serves as the primary guardian of these terms.

6.2 Legal Backing: While democratic process is primary, traditional legal mechanisms support this license where democratic processes are circumvented or ignored.

6.3 License Evolution: This license may be modified through proposals and votes within The Change App, following the same democratic processes that govern the software itself.
ARTICLE VII: TRADITIONAL LEGAL SAFEGUARDS

7.1 Copyright Protection: TAObaeus Rushaeus retains copyright ownership of the founding proposal and original code, subject to modification through legitimate democratic processes only.

7.2 Disclaimer of Warranty: This software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind.

7.3 Limitation of Liability: The copyright holder shall not be liable for damages arising from use of this software.

NOTICE TO DEVELOPERS AND USERS

This is Democracy-Governed Source-Available Software. You may inspect, study, and audit this code freely. There are, however, no inherent rights to modify, fork, or redistribute this software. All such actions are explicitly forbidden outside of the platform's democratic process.

The ability to propose a modification is a privileged action, earned by posting an ACent bond and submitting a "Technical Proposal" through the designated internal development system. This ensures that every contributor is financially and reputationally invested in the quality and security of their work.

The community rules. The code serves the democracy. The democracy evolves the code.
