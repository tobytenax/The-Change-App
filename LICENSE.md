 ###PREAMBLE: THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE 
 
This is NOT a traditional software license. 
 
This is a Living License that embodies the same democratic principles as the software it governs. 
 
Just as The Change App evolves through the collective wisdom of its users, 

so too shall this license evolve through the democratic processes embedded within the platform itself. 

 
 The Revolutionary Principle: 
 
Rather than static legal text carved in stone by lawyers, 

this license places its own governance in the hands of the very democracy it protects. 

The Change App community - 

through its established competence verification and proposal systems - 

becomes the ultimate authority over how this software may be used, modified, and distributed. 


 Transparency Through Source Availability: 

The code is fully visible and auditable, ensuring complete transparency. 

However, the rights to modify, distribute, and govern 

this software are not granted through traditional legal mechanisms, 

but earned through participation in the 

democratic processes that define The Change App itself. 
 
 
###ARTICLE I: FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES 


 1.1 The Democratic Governance Model 
 
This license operates under the principle that 

legitimate authority derives from competent democratic participation. 

All decisions regarding the modification, distribution, 

and governance of The Change App shall be made through 

the platform's own proposal and voting systems, 

where participants must demonstrate competence through quiz-based verification. 


 1.2 The Living Contract 
 
This license, like The Change App itself, is a Living Document. 

Its terms may be modified only through proposals submitted and voted upon 

within The Change App platform, 

following all established competence verification and voting procedures. 


 1.3 Source Transparency 
 
The complete source code is made available for 

inspection, audit, and understanding. 

This transparency serves democracy

by ensuring no hidden mechanisms 

or backdoors exist that could subvert the democratic process. 


###ARTICLE II: INITIAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE 


 2.1 The Founding Authority 
 
TAObaeus Rushaeus is established as the Founding Authority of The Change App,

with the founding proposal "Take Our Planet Back Block by Block" 

serving as the constitutional foundation of this democratic system. 


 2.2 Founding Protection Period 
 
For the initial governance period, the following elements are protected from modification: 

   The founding proposal and its embedded governance principles 
 
   The core democratic mechanisms (competence verification, proposal systems, voting procedures) 
 
   The dual-token economy (ACents and DCents) 
 
   The attribution of TAObaeus Rushaeus as founder 
   

 2.3 Democratic Evolution Pathway 
 
These protections may be modified or removed ONLY through 

the democratic processes established within 

The Change App itself, requiring:

  Submission of properly formatted proposals 
  
  Competence verification of voting participants 
  
  Achievement of democratic consensus as defined by the platform's governance mechanisms 


###ARTICLE III: USAGE RIGHTS AND RESTRICTIONS 


 3.1 Inspection and Study Rights

  Earn authority through demonstrated competence within the platform 
  

 3.3 Fork and Modification Restrictions 
 
No Traditional Forking: 

  Unlike conventional open source software, 
  
  this code may not be forked, modified, or redistributed 
  
  outside of The Change App's democratic governance structure. 

  Any legitimate modifications must emerge from within the democratic process itself.

 
 Democratic Modification Only: 
 
  Changes to the software must be proposed, debated, and voted upon 
 
  by the verified competent participants of The Change App community, 
 
  following all established democratic procedures. 
 
 
 3.4 Deployment Restrictions 
 
Any deployment of The Change App must:

  Maintain the democratic governance mechanisms 
  
  Preserve the competence verification systems 
  
  Attribute TAObaeus Rushaeus as founder 
  
  Connect to or establish legitimate Change App democratic processes 


ARTICLE IV: THE DEMOCRATIC OVERRIDE PRINCIPLE 


 4.1 Community Sovereignty 
 
The Change App community, through its democratic processes,

holds ultimate sovereignty over this software and license. 

This includes the theoretical power to: 

  Modify or replace leadership structures 
  
  Alter the governance mechanisms themselves 
  
  Change distribution and usage terms 
  
  Remove or modify founder attributions 
  

 4.2 Competence-Based Authority 
 
Such changes require legitimate democratic consensus achieved through: 

  Proper proposal submission procedures 

  Competence verification of all voting participants 

  Achievement of required voting thresholds 

  Following all established democratic safeguards 
  

 4.3 Protection Against Hostile Takeovers 
 
This democratic override principle protects against 

hostile takeovers by requiring would-be controllers to: 

  Participate legitimately in the democratic process 

  Demonstrate competence in relevant areas 
  
  Build genuine community consensus 
  
  Follow established procedural safeguards 


###ARTICLE V: ENFORCEMENT AND EVOLUTION 


 5.1 Enforcement Mechanism 
 
This license is enforced primarily through 

the democratic mechanisms of The Change App itself. 

The community serves as the primary guardian of these terms. 


 5.2 Legal Backing 
 
While democratic process is primary, 

traditional legal mechanisms support this license 

where democratic processes are circumvented or ignored. 


 5.3 License Evolution 
 
This license may be modified through proposals and votes 

within The Change App, following the same 

democratic processes that govern the software itself. 


ARTICLE VI: TRADITIONAL LEGAL SAFEGUARDS 


 6.1 Copyright Protection 
 
TAObaeus Rushaeus retains copyright ownership 

of the founding proposal and original code, 

subject to modification through legitimate democratic processes only. 


 6.2 Disclaimer of Warranty 
 
This software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. 


 6.3 Limitation of Liability 
 
The copyright holder shall not be liable 

for damages arising from use of this software.
