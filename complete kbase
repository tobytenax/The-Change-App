###The Change App: Complete Technical Knowledge Base (Final Draft)

Document Purpose: This document is the single source of truth for the architectural and mechanical design of The Change App. It contains all system rules, tokenomics, governance procedures, and technical specifications necessary for implementation. It supersedes all previous notes and discussions.

###1. Core Philosophy & Architecture

    ###Name: The Change App - A Living Democracy Platform

    Foundation: Direct democracy with competence verification and granular liquid delegations.

    Core Technology: Autobase. The system is event-driven, using Autobase for its decentralized, multi-writer data structures and consensus model.

    UI/UX Philosophy: The user interface and experience (UI/UX) will draw heavy inspiration from Reddit, prioritizing clear hierarchical discussion threads and intuitive voting mechanisms.

    Operating Model: The platform operates on an eventual consistency model, where conflict is a feature that drives the evolution and refinement of proposals.

    Scale: The system is designed to scale logarithmically across geographic jurisdictions, from Neighborhood up to Global and beyond.

###2. The Dual-Token Economy

The platform's economy is powered by two distinct, merit-based tokens.

ACents (Competence-Based Tokens)

    Purpose: To measure and reward demonstrated competence. ACents are fully transferable between users.

    Earning Mechanisms:

        Tutorial Quiz Pass: 1 ACent.

        Founding Proposal Vote: 1 ACent.

        Successful Referral: 1 ACent.

        Random "Ambush" Quizzes: Passing periodic, random quizzes on various topics earns ACents.

        Proposal Upvotes: 1 ACent per upvote is added to the proposal's escrow account.

        Casting a Delegated Vote: 0.5 ACent (split with the delegator).

        Comment Integration: ACents are paid from the proposal's "Commenter Pool".

    Spending Mechanisms:

        Proposal Submission: Costs 3 ACents.

        Implementer Bond: A variable amount of ACents posted by an implementer.

DCents (Participation-Based Tokens)

    Purpose: To enable participation (commenting, delegation) for users who have not passed a competence quiz on a given topic.

    Earning Mechanisms:

        Quiz Failure: 1 DCent.

        Voting on Comments: 1 DCent per vote (up or down).

    Spending Mechanisms:

        Commenting (for non-quiz-passers): Costs 3 DCents.

Onboarding Economic Design

The initial token distribution is precisely calibrated. A user who passes the tutorial quiz (1 ACent), votes on the founding proposal (1 ACent), and successfully refers one new user (1 ACent) will have exactly 3 ACentsâ€”the cost of submitting their first proposal. This design intentionally creates a high bar for initial proposals to ensure quality.

###3. User Lifecycle & Onboarding

    Registration: A new user creates an account.

    Tutorial & Quiz: The user completes a mandatory tutorial, followed by a competence quiz.

    First Token: Upon passing, the user receives 1 ACent. If they fail, they receive 1 DCent.

    Founding Proposal: The user gains access to the founding proposal.

    First Vote & Second Token: By voting on the founding proposal, the user earns their second ACent.

###4. Competence Verification System (Quizzes)

    Quiz Creation: Proposal authors suggest questions. An uncensored AI model then cross-references and suggests edits.

        AI Model Note: The current candidate is a Llama-based model, chosen for its ability to perform this task neutrally.

    Passing Threshold: A score of 75% is required to pass.

    Failure Path: On failure, the user receives 1 DCent and can delegate their vote.

    Second Chance (Genius Protection): After a failure, a user can submit a free-response essay. An AI analyzes this to distinguish unconventional wisdom from incompetence. A human review can be initiated if the user disputes the AI's assessment.

    Random "Ambush" Quizzes: The system will randomly present users with quizzes on various topics. This allows users to build a reserve of ACents and helps the platform map users' general knowledge domains.

###5. The Proposal Lifecycle

    Creation: A user with at least 3 ACents submits a proposal.

    Voting & Funding: The proposal is voted on by competent users. Each upvote adds 1 ACent to the proposal's escrow.

    Scaling: The proposal scales to higher geographic levels by meeting thresholds for both competence (MVC) and participation (MPS).

    Evolution: The proposal text is amended and improved as comments from the "Alchemical Zone" are integrated.

    Implementation: Once sufficiently funded, the proposal moves to the Implementer Marketplace.

###6. The Implementer Marketplace & Escrow System

    Bidding: "Implementers" bid on funded proposals by posting an ACent-based bond.

    Bond Requirement: The bond must be at least 20% of the proposal's total escrow value.

    Implementer Competence: Implementers are not required to be subject-matter experts. Their role is to execute the competent instructions encoded in the proposal text.

    Selection: The proposal author and all integrated commenters deliberate and approve an Implementer's bid.

    Escrow Payout & Verification:

        Payout Split:

            Implementer: 40% (Receives half upfront, half upon completion).

            Author: 30%.

            Integrated Commenters: 30% (split proportionally).

        Watchdog Incentive: The Author and Commenters do not receive their payouts until they unanimously verify the project's completion, incentivizing oversight.

###7. The Alchemical Zone (Comment & Integration System)

    Commenting Access: Users who pass a proposal's quiz can comment for free. Others must spend 3 DCents.

    Comment Voting: Any user can vote on comments, earning 1 DCent per vote.

    Manual Integration: The proposal author can integrate any comment at any time.

    Auto-Integration:

        Threshold: When a comment's upvote count equals the proposal's upvote count, it is automatically integrated.

        Restriction: Auto-integration only applies at the City level and higher.

        Overrule Protection: An author cannot prevent integration once a comment's support exceeds the proposal's support.

    Economic Conversion: When a comment is integrated, the commenter is paid in ACents from the 30% "Commenter Pool" of the proposal's escrow.

###8. Delegation System

    Mechanics: A user can delegate their vote on any proposal for which they are not quiz-certified. Delegations are fluid and can be revoked at any time.

    Designation: A user can delegate to their referrer (default), or any other user. Non-users can be invited.

    Economic Incentives: When a delegated vote is cast, the reward is split: 0.5 ACent to the delegator and 0.5 ACent to the vote caster. Only the first cast of a vote is rewarded.

###9. Geographic Scaling System

A proposal must meet thresholds for both Minimum Verified Competence (MVC) and Minimum Popular Support (MPS) to scale.
Jurisdiction	Approx. Population	MVC (ACents)	MPS (Voters)
Neighborhood	100 - 2,000	15	50
City / Town	2,000 - 100,000	150	750
State / Province	100K - 10M	1,500	15,000
Country	10M - 100M	15,000	150,000
Continent	100M - 500M	75,000	1,000,000
World	500M+	150,000	5,000,000

###Appendix A: Founder's Proposal ("Take Our Planet Back Block by Block")

We would much prefer that these truths had been self-evident, but experience dictates this to be one of those instances wherein the truths held dearest to our hearts have to be spelled out in explicit detail for the institutions that we've founded to serve us. Therefore we, the users of The Change App, hereby establish not merely an application, but a new social contract for the digital world. We found a Living Democracy comprised of Living Proposals, and we inscribe into its immutable heart a Bill of Digital Rights, that our evolution may be guided by principle and protected from the failures of the past.

We declare that the authority of any technology must be derived from the informed consent of the people it serves. To this end, we establish the ACent not just as a measure of competence, but as a unit of trust earned in the defense of these rights.

Our Digital Bill of Rights shall be the foundation upon which all proposals are built:

    Article 1- The Right to Privacy: Our digital lives, communications, and movements are inviolable. Surveillance shall not be the default state of existence.

    Article 2 - The Right to Human Review: No person shall be subject to a final decision made solely by an algorithm. Every user retains the irrevocable right to appeal to a jury of their competent peers.

    Article 3- Protection Against Predictive Policing: We ban the use of data to forecast criminal behavior, for such practices punish possibility instead of action and perpetuate ancient biases under a mask of technological neutrality.

    Article 4 - The Right to Encryption: The right to private conversation is a cornerstone of free society. This right extends irrevocably to the digital realm.

    Article 5- The Right to Control One's Data: We are not products. Our data is our property. Its terms of use are ours to set and revoke.

    Article 6 - The Right to Mandatory AI Bias Audits: Any system that adjudicates, evaluates, or gates-keeps must submit to regular, public, and competent audits for bias and fairness. Transparency is non-negotiable.

    Article 7 - Ban on Covert Biometrics: The use of facial recognition and other biometric surveillance in public places without explicit, prior community consent is hereby forbidden. We will not live in a panopticon.

    Article 8- The Right to be Forgotten: The right to move on, to evolve, and to leave past mistakes behind is essential to human dignity. This right extends to our digital footprints.

    Article 9- Community Consent for Data Extraction: The data of our community is a common resource. Its extraction by any entity, corporate or state, requires the informed consent of the community itself, expressed through democratic deliberation.

    Article 10- The Right to Digital Sanctuary: Every individual has the right to exist online without being relentlessly targeted, manipulated, or harassed by automated systems. Our minds are our own.

Let this Covenant be the bedrock of our new digital society. Let it be the litmus test for every proposal, the shield for every user, and the promise we make to the future.

May each adopter of this new way agree to defend these foundations set forth on this day. May these words remain embedded immutably at the very core of this network.

Let no part of this Covenant be stricken from the source except through the observance of its own internal processesâ€”the competent, democratic will of the people it protects.

Let us all recognize here and now that by and through each one of our acceptance of this new social contract, we lay to rest the revolution in favor of our evolution.

What say you, Human? Will you lay aside your arms and take up The Change App to defend these rights, enrich yourself, and add value to the lives of every reflection that looks back at you? From block to block, we'll ACend higher and higher.
