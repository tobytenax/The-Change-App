## Preamble: The Diagnosis

Humanity struggles with governance that balances competence, participation, and accountability. Traditional systems centralize power, disenfranchising capable voices, or fragment authority, diluting accountability. We inhabit a world increasingly defined by the failures of these systems to respond with agility to the speed and complexity of contemporary crises.

The core of this dysfunction is a persistent mismatch: **authority is frequently decoupled from competence**. The systems upon which civilization depends are simultaneously brittle and opaque, rewarding the few while disenfranchising the many.

The Diagnosis is clear: we cannot continue to trust traditional hierarchies, unmediated market logic, or rigid bureaucracies to steward our collective destiny. The emergent world demands a platform where competence is recognized, delegated responsibly, and amplified through participation‚Äîa system that transforms conflict into insight, debate into action, and disagreement into evolutionary progress.

## The Core Insight

The Change App envisions a platform where governance itself becomes a living organism, fueled by competence and participation, mediated by economic incentives, and guided by the principles of eventual consistency. Authority without competence is dangerous, competence without influence is impotent, and influence without accountability is corrupting.

This model doesn't resolve conflict in the sense of making it disappear. It cultivates it. The system is a garden:

-   **Proposals** are the plants.
-   **Conflict in the comments** is the pruning and weeding.
-   **Acent votes** are the sunlight (competence).
-   **Dcent delegations** are the water (popular support).
-   **Eventual Consistency** is the seasons‚Äîchange doesn't happen instantly, but it is inevitable and leads to new growth.

The result is a robust, adaptive, and deeply democratic system where rules are not dictated but evolved, and where every conflict is an opportunity to learn, refine, and build a more legitimate consensus.

## ‚ú® Architecture of Wisdom in Action

This is not mere software design; it is social engineering at scale, encoded in a living, event-driven organism whose heartbeat is the interaction of human minds.

### 1. Dual Token Economy (ACents & DCents)

-   **ACents (Competence Tokens)**: Earned by passing competence quizzes, successful referrals, and valuable contributions. They are spent to submit proposals and act as a measure of demonstrated understanding.
-   **DCents (Participation Tokens)**: Earned through participation, such as voting on comments or attempting quizzes. They allow users who haven't yet passed a competence quiz to engage in the system by commenting or delegating their vote.

### 2. Competence-Based Voting & Delegation

-   **Verification**: Users must pass quizzes on a proposal's subject matter to earn ACents and vote directly.
-   **Delegation**: Users can delegate their voting power to other trusted individuals, creating fluid hierarchies of expertise. Delegation is revocable at any time, ensuring continuous accountability.

### 3. Proposal Lifecycle & Escrow

-   **Funding**: Proposals accrue ACents in an escrow account as they gain upvotes.
-   **Implementation**: Once funded, implementers can bid for the work by posting their own ACents as a bond.
-   **Payouts**: Payouts are tied to verified completion and split between the author (30%), integrated commenters (30%), and the implementer (40%). This aligns all incentives toward successful outcomes.

### 4. Geographic Scaling: The Fractal Vision

-   Proposals can rise from local to global importance if they gather enough support. The system is designed to scale logarithmically, from a single neighborhood to a city, state, country, continent, and eventually to planetary and interstellar governance. The principles of the neighborhood inform the city; the city informs the nation; the nation informs the world.

## üöÄ Roadmap

1.  **MVP**: Neighborhood-level proposals, competence quizzes, and delegation.
2.  **Scaling**: City ‚Üí State ‚Üí Nation ‚Üí World.
3.  **Economy**: Full implementation of token escrow and implementer bonding.
4.  **Expansion**: Non-human and interstellar participation.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributing to The Change App is a unique process that reflects the core principles of the platform itself. As outlined in the **Change App Living Democracy License (CADL)**, modifications and improvements are not managed through traditional forks and pull requests.

Instead, all changes must be proposed, debated, and approved through the democratic mechanisms of the app. To contribute, you must:

1.  **Become a Participant:** Engage with the Change App as a user and become a verified member of the community.
2.  **Demonstrate Competence:** Participate in the competence verification quizzes to earn the right to vote and propose.
3.  **Propose Changes:** Submit your ideas for bug fixes, new features, or modifications through the platform's official proposal system.
4.  **Build Consensus:** Engage in discussion, demonstrate the value of your proposed changes, and build democratic consensus for implementation.

True contribution is participation in the democracy.
